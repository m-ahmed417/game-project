Memory Game
This is a simple memory game built with JavaScript. The game displays a grid of cards, each with a hidden image of a football club logo. The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards by clicking on two cards at a time to reveal their images. If the images match, the cards remain visible and the player earns points. If the images do not match, the cards are flipped back over and the player tries again. The game continues until all pairs have been matched.
